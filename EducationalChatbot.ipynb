The \\nadvancement of technology, in accordance with knowledge and skill, has accelerated the pace \\nof change. There is no alternative to adapting to this fast changing world. The reason is, the \\ndevelopment of technology is at its zenith compared to any time in the human history. In the \\nfourth industrial revolution era, the advancement of artificial intelligence has brought a drastic \\nchange in our employment and lifestyles and this will make the relationship among people \\nmore and more intimate. Varied employment opportunities will be created in near future which \\nwe cannot even predict at this moment. We need to take preparation right now so that we can \\nadapt ourselves to that upcoming future.\\nAlthough a huge economic development has taken place throughout the world, the problems of \\nclimate change, air pollution, migrations and ethnic violence have become much more intense \\nthan before. The epidemics like COVID 19 has appeared and obstructed the normal lifestyle \\nand economic growth of the world. Different challenges and opportunities have been added to \\nour daily life.\\nStanding on the verge of these challenges and possibilities, implementation of sustainable and \\neffective solutions is required for the transformation of our large population into a resource. \\nIt entails global citizens with knowledge, skill, values, vision, positive attitude, sensitivity, \\ncapability to adapt, humanity and patriotism. Amidst all these, Bangladesh has graduated into \\na developing nation from the underdeveloped periphery and is continuously trying to achieve \\nthe desired goals in order to become a developed country by 2041. Education is one of the \\npivotal instruments to attain the goals and there is no alternative to the modernization of our \\neducation system. Developing an effective and updated curriculum has become crucial for this \\nmodernization.\\nDeveloping and revising the curriculum is a regular and vital activity of National Curriculum \\nand Textbook Board. The last revision of the curriculum was done in 2012. Since then, a lot \\nof time has passed. The necessity of curriculum revision and development has emerged. For \\nthis purpose, various research and technical exercises were conducted under the supervision \\nof NCTB during the year 2017 to 2019 to analyze the prevalent situation of education and \\nassess the learning needs. Based on the researches and technical exercises, a competency-\\nbased incessant curriculum from K-12 has been developed to create a competent generation to \\nsurvive in the new world situation.\\nIn the light of the competency based curriculum, the textbooks have been prepared for all \\nstreams (General, Madrasah and V ocational) of learners for grade Six. The authentic experience \\ndriven contents of this textbook were developed in such a way that teaching learning becomes \\ncomprehensible and full of merriment.

We hope that learning will \\nbe profound and life-long now.\\nIssues like gender, ethnicity, religion, caste, the disadvantaged and students with special needs \\nhave been taken into special consideration while developing the textbook.

Congratulations to you!\\nEnrollment in Class Six means you are entering secondary level after completing the primary education.\\nWe are waiting for you with a new learning approach. In this new approach, you do not have to run \\nafter examinations and good marks any longer. You do not have to just know the probable questions \\nfor examinations and spend time looking for the answers. From now on, it is not your principal duty \\nto memorise answers. Your parents also do not have to worry about effective tutors, coaching centers, \\nguidebooks, your exams and question papers. There will be no need to spend a lot of money for nothing.\\nWe know that every one of you has a fresh mind and a very active brain. You have not only the power of \\nimagination but also sharp intellect with which you discover different ways of thinking. All of you are \\nborn with some other faculties like the mind and brain. We want to talk about these in particular. We are \\ntalking about human senses. You have already known that we all have five special organs – eyes, ears, \\nnose, tongue and skin. These organs function as the senses. We see with the eyes and this power is called \\neyesight while the organ is called visual sensory organ. Similarly, we hear with the ears and these are \\nauditory organs. We smell with the nose which is the olfactory organ. We taste with the tongue and it is \\nthe gustatory organ. We feel touches with the skin and it is the tactile organ. They help us to recognize, \\nunderstand and know something. This is why these senses are very important.\\nTogether with all these assets each of you have –\\nPerpetual vitality\\nLimitless curiosity\\nImmense ability to enjoy, and\\nA natural tendency to wonder.\\nModern educational specialists believe that the stress of examinations and memorization of answers \\nhinders the development of these natural abilities. Rather, students need to use these abilities for learning \\nnew things, and this only can give good results.\\nYou are surely getting the notion about your own work after hearing these views. Of course, you are \\ngoing to enjoy a lot of freedom in this system. However, do not forget that you have to take responsibility \\nto enjoy your freedom. After all, study is your own job; it is for yourself. You will do your own work;that \\nis a very good thing.\\nThe reality is, when you succeed in something, you can understand how much joy it brings. Therefore, \\nlearning in the new way will be a joyful journey, an expedition. In Rabindranath’s songs, we find a \\njoyous melody of a journey. Education is the joyous song of an expedition that continues while you \\nwalk along humming a melody. You have just enrolled in Class Six. You have gained experience from \\nlessons in Class Five. Many of the lessons in the new class will be new, with many things unknown. This \\njourney will be like an expedition for the unknown and new things. You will know, learn and do a lot \\nwhile overcoming the challenges on the way. You will get endless joy as well.\\nThis does not require any additional cost. It is because you have your own mighty tools in your arsenal \\nto meet challenges – curiosity, wonder, vitality, and the ability to be joyful. The senses play a supportive \\nrole in this process. The fun is that these are not like money – instead of being spent, these always grow. \\nThese are the resources of your mind and so the more you practice, the more they will shine, the more \\nefficient they will be. Moreover, these will inspire you to uncover new abilities. Intellect is the first to \\ncall. You have to use your own intellect; you have to think. You need logic to think right. This is an area \\nfor practice – if you cultivate intellect, it will increase. You may have seen that if you prune the branches \\nand leaves of some trees, the trees grow better and give more fruits. You need to sharpen your mind, \\nsharpen your logic. Also, the senses have to be kept alert to increase their abilities.\\nIn this way, you will conquer the unknown. You will keep on spreading light in the darkness, and you \\nwill not even notice when many things have been grasped. Let this journey towards victory begin!\\nIntroduction', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

It was a calm and secluded village in Bengal. \\nLike any other villages, plenty of fish was also found there while the chirping of \\nbirds filled its ambiance. The cattle used to graze in the fields. There were brick-\\nbuilt houses, mud-built shanties with tin rooftops, bamboo-fenced shacks, and small \\nhuts made of vannya (a locally grown castor bean plant) leaves. Neither there was \\nelectricity nor properly paved roads for transport facilities. People used to travel on \\nfoot. But there were boats of different sizes and shapes. \\nOn 17 March 1920, Mujib was born to Sheikh Lutfar Rahman and Sayera Khatun. \\nEveryone in the family was very excited when he was born as the first child of his \\nparents. \\nHe was named Mujibur Rahman; ‘Sheikh’ was added before as a family name. His \\nparents used to call him Khoka and thus it became his nickname. Khoka was gradually \\ngrowing up in Tungipara with her mother. Since childhood, he was interested in \\nsports. He had a children’s team, and he was the leader.

He was \\nknown as Serestadar (Chief clerk, a Farsi (Persian) word). Once upon a time, Farsi \\nwas the state language, that is the language used in the courts and offices.\\nSo, from the calm and serene village, Mujib moved to Gopalganj to study in a high \\nschool there.

He wrote about this when he grew up ‘I \\nwas quite mischievous and playful when I was a child.

It was the centre of all amenities like good doctors and hospitals, \\nmarkets and shops, schools and colleges. \\nHe fell behind in his studies due to illness. In 1936, he returned to school to resume \\nhis studies. Then he was admitted to the Madaripur High School as in the meantime, \\nhis father was transferred to Madaripur.

Huseyn \\nShaheed Suhrawardy (1892-1963) was another notable politician at that time. He \\nwas a very prominent leader and the then Labour Minister. A conference was decided \\nto be arranged with the eminent political leaders. Along with it, there would be an \\nexhibition to display local agricultural products and other handicrafts. Mujib was the \\nleader of the volunteers who would organise the conference. \\nEverything ends well. After the conference, when the leaders were about to leave, \\nMujib approached them and placed a demand to repair the school hostel rooftop as \\nstudents used to suffer a lot during the rainy season because of the leaking rooftop. His \\nteachers were not only overwhelmed by his courage but also became a bit petrified \\nthinking the leaders might get upset. However, the true leaders might have had seen \\nthe qualities of a future leader in him. \\nHe was actively engaged in social works and sports while he was progressing towards \\nthe end of his school education.

Due to some \\nfamily issues, she had to leave Bhagalpur and move to kolkata. And there at number \\n13 Waliullah Lane on 16 March 1911, the Sakhawat Memorial Girls' School got \\npermanently established by Begum Rokeya. Though it started with just eight female \\nstudents, gradually the number got increased.   \\nRokeya did not have any institutional degree. Despite this, she did all the administrative \\nand academic work flawlessly. She said, ‘Not just the education based on books, our \\nmain objective is to motivate the girls to serve others, serve the nation and dedicate \\ntheir lives in the service of the society.’ \\nRokeya continued with her literary work besides running the school. She wrote poems, \\nshort stories, novels and essays. Truth and justice were the predominant themes her \\nwriting. In her essays, she blatantly and fearlessly criticised the injustice and cruelty \\nimposed on women in the society.  \\nIn 1916, Rokeya established Anjuman-e-Khawateen-e-Islam or Muslim Mahila Samiti \\n(Muslim Women’s Society). The purpose of this society was to establish women’s \\nrole in the society and the state. \\nIn her life, Rokeya took women’s education as a vow. In her literary works also, she \\nwanted to reiterate this philosophy and values. She wanted to say over and over again \\nin her writing that women need to wake up, otherwise no emancipation is possible. \\nHer other ideal was integrity. She said, ‘Truth, whether you like it or not, we should \\nunderstand it, search for it and accept it.’\\nIt was December 9 in 1932. It was her 52nd birthday. She woke up very early in the \\nmorning and performed her ablution. Suddenly, she felt chest pain.

They started considering him as a maestro. \\nHe was made a member of the British parliament. The King awarded him with \\nknighthood, and was given the title Sir. The Royal Society, which was the institution \\nof all the experts, elected him as their President. His name was Isaac Newton. \\nNewton was born on 25 December 1642. His father who was a farmer, died before he \\nwas born. He studied in the village school in his childhood. But instead of studying, \\nhe was more interested in the sundial, water clock, and other tools and gadgets. \\nWhen he was sixteen years of age, a terrible storm hit Britain. How strong and wild \\nthe wind was! Not many such violent storms hit in the history of Britain. At that \\ntime Newton was very much into measuring the wind force. When the storm was at \\nits peak, he came out of the house. He jumped following the direction of the wind \\nand marked the spot. Then he jumped against the wind and marked the spot. The \\nneighbours noticed his madness through the windows of their houses. \\nAll his relatives thought that he would become a farmer like his father. However, he \\ndeveloped a strong interest in reading scientific books and doing strange experiments. \\nOnce he was sent to the market to sell sheep, a few eggs and some other things. \\nInstead, he sent another person to see things on his behalf and he sat down behind a \\nbush to be totally engrossed by a maths book. \\nHe was later found after a frenzied search and everyone in the family got furious. \\nWhat could be done with such an irresponsible young man, they all thought. One of \\nhis uncles rescued him from such unpleasant situation. He suggested, ‘Send him to a \\ncollege. There he can do as much maths as he wishes.’ As a result, Newton was sent \\nto Cambridge. \\nNewton really excelled in maths in Cambridge. In his first year of college, he invented \\ncalculus, an entirely new concept in maths. He wrote a full paper on it, kept all the \\nrecords but he did not publish it. \\nDuring his first year of college, he also invented why disc-like objects around the \\nmoon emit light. According to him, this is created because of the light reflection on \\nwater molecules in the atmosphere. \\nAt the age of 23, he became a professor of mathematics. The next year, Britain was \\naffected by the plague. Schools and colleges were shut down. Newton went back to \\nhis village and concentrated on research. He kept trying to find solutions for whatever \\nproblems appeared in his mind through mathematics. That was the time in village \\nwhen Newton formulated the foundations of his remarkable inventions before he \\neven turned 25. \\nHow do the planets revolve around the sun?

He thought ‘If an apple falls down from the tree, how does the moon float in \\nthe atmosphere rather than falling on the earth?’ Then he thought that the earth must \\nattract the moon. However, as the moon revolves around the earth, that is why the \\nattraction between them becomes neutral. \\nNewton calculated the exact revolving pace of the moon which would neutralise the \\nearth’s gravity. And what a wonder it was! His calculation matched exactly with the \\nastronomer’s calculation of the revolving pace of the moon. To everyone’s amazement, \\nNewton's Theory of Gravity could be used to calculate all the movements of other \\nplanets. \\nHe always had a strong attraction towards light. What is light made of - lamp light, \\nsunlight, and star lights? He was fully engrossed into the experiments with light. \\nNewton was aware of the telescope that Galileo built. Newton measured the movement \\nof light inside the telescope. Then he built a new type of telescope whose diameter was \\njust one inch, and the length was mere two inches. However, he could observe long-\\ndistanced elements forty times larger with this new telescope. With this telescope, he \\ndiscovered the satellites of Jupiter. Then Newton with the help of a prism showed that \\nthe light contains the combination of seven colours (rainbow). \\nNewton was a simple person. At that time, scientists used to publish immediately after \\nthe invention. However, Newton never prioritised that. He was always so occupied in \\ninventing something new that he never paid much attention in publishing. \\nThere are many stories around how engrossed Newton used to become in his research, \\nand what an absent-minded person he was. Once he invited one of his friends to \\ndinner. Newton was not home when his friend arrived. The friend found a roasted \\nchicken on the table. It was covered. His friend was waiting for almost two hours. \\nWithout further delay, his friend ate the chicken. Only the bones were left on the plate. \\nAfter returning home, Newton removed the cover and said, ‘I thought, I didn’t take \\nmy dinner but now I realised that I had taken it earlier.’ The two friends then started a \\nlong conversation on science. \\nDo you want to know what Newton said about himself? ‘I do not know what I may \\nappear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the \\nseashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier \\nshell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.’\\nOur Identity\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Therefore, everyone is eagerly waiting for Khushi Apa. Some of the students \\nhave brought photos of their favourite players in their bags. They are taking these out \\nevery now and then to show these to everyone. In the meantime, Khushi Apa with a \\nwide smile on her face enters the class and she carries a football in her hand. There is \\nexcitement among everyone.  \\nUsing hand gestures, Khushi Apa asks everyone to be quiet and says, ‘Are you all \\nready?’ All enthusiastically reply together, ‘Yes, we’re ready.’\\nKhushi Apa says, ‘Let us form two teams. First, we need to select two captains. Then, \\nthe captain will select other players. You should bear in mind that the team should \\nbe all-inclusive and must have a good balance of boys and girls, and students with \\nspecial needs.’ She also adds, ‘Everyone should have equal opportunities to perform \\naccording to their ability.’ \\nThen Shamima proposes, ‘Neela and Ganesh can be our two captains.’ On the other \\nhand, Mozammel proposes Francis and Rupa’s names as the captains. Everyone \\nbecomes a bit anxious for a moment thinking about how to select two from these \\nfour names. Anusandhan proposes, ‘We can elect two captains by voting.’ Neela and \\nGanesh are elected captains by vote. After that, Neela and Ganesh form their own \\nteams. \\nGoing to the school ground, Khushi Apa says, ‘Today you will play in a different \\nway as there will be no rules. Players can play with liberty.’ Hearing this, everyone \\nbecomes very happy and excited thinking that there will be so many goals today that \\nit will be hard to keep a count. Khadija, one of their classmates, is acting as a referee \\nfor today’s game. As soon as Khadija blows the whistle, the game starts. With lots of \\nhappiness and enthusiasm, everybody keeps trying to play football without following \\nany rules for 15 minutes. Then, Khushi Apa declares the end of the first half played \\nwithout any rules.

Is it the village \\nthey called Shyamoli!\\nEveryone simply wondered how the beautiful village turned into a dull place. However, \\nno one knew how to get back the earlier life of the village. In this situation, a group \\nof boys and girls from the village got together. They thought that the situation needed \\na change! They decided to get back the almost disappearing aspects of the village – \\nthe greenery, various colourful animals, birds, insects and the river brimming with \\nwater. They did not know how to achieve this goal. One day they sat together for a \\ndiscussion. They wanted to figure out a solution. After the discussion, they found they \\ndid not know many necessary things about the problem. That is why they could not \\nsolve the problem. They did a lot of brainstorming and then they came up with some \\nissues. Without understanding those issues, they could not solve the problem. Those \\nwere -\\n ● What was the number of plants, animals and insects in the forest? And what \\nwas the amount of rainfall and river water before?\\n ● What is the number of plants, animals and insects in the forest now? And \\nwhat is the amount of rainfall and river water now?\\n ● Why did the number of plants, animals and insects in the forest, and the \\namount of rainfall and river water decrease?\\n ● What can we do to increase the number of plants, animals and insects in the \\nforest, and the amount of rainfall and river water?\\nThey were very happy to be able to identify the problems. Then they began thinking \\nabout how they could find answers to the questions. They also thought about where \\nthey could go and from whom they could find answers. They came to know from their \\nteacher that people at the office of the forest department in their village worked with \\nwildlife and forest-grown trees. They could get answers to their questions from these \\npeople.\\nFollowing their teacher’s advice, they looked for information in the library of the \\nforest department. They borrowed many books and reports which could offer answers \\nto their questions. They studied those materials for quite some days. They came to \\nknow a lot of things about forests, trees and animals in the forest. However, they failed \\nto find a suitable answer. Although the information was related to their questions, it \\nfailed to offer any direct answer to their problem. The books and reports told them \\nabout the number of trees and animals in the forest in earlier times and in the present \\ntime.  They noticed that at the start of the problem the number of wolves dropped \\nall of a sudden. Then the number of trees decreased quite fast, but the number of \\nherbivores began to increase. They could not find any direct relationship between this \\nscenario and that of Shyamoli village. So they again went to their teacher.

So the students \\nhurried towards him. The researcher listened to their problems and questions with \\nmuch attention. He said, ‘It seems I have understood the problem you are talking \\nabout. At one time, all kinds of plants, birds and animals in the forest depended on \\neach other and they lived in peace. For example, grass and plants depend on the soil \\nfor food while deer, cows and buffalos survive by eating grass and herbs. On the other \\nhand, wolves hunt herbivores such as deer, cows, buffaloes, etc. for food. Everything \\nwas going well. Problem began when a group of hunters in the village killed all the \\nwolves on the pretext of ensuring safety of the village.’ Students asked, ‘What is the \\nrelationship between the arising of the problem and the decrease in the number of \\nwolves?’ The researcher explained, ‘You may have noticed that all the animals and \\nplants of the forest depend on each other for survival. The wolves hunted deer, cows, \\nbuffaloes and other herbivores for food. When there were no wolves, the number \\nof herbivores including the deer increased quite fast. This is why you have found \\nin the reports that when the number of wolves decreased, the number of herbivores \\nincreased.’ Students exclaimed, ‘Now we can understand! And as the number of \\nherbivores increased, the vegetation dropped. The number dropped sharply because \\nmore herbivores ate up more plants.’ The researcher said, ‘You got it right. And as \\nthe vegetation decreased, so did the amount of rainfall in this area. As a result, the \\nriver water also dropped low. The surroundings became dry and dull.’ The students \\ncried out in excitement, ‘Now we have found out how the problem began. We have \\nto figure out how to solve the problem.’ One of them said, ‘We can plant a lot of trees \\nso that the rainfall increases again!’ The remaining students said, ‘But the herbivores \\nwill eat them up again. We can release some wolves in the forest instead. They will \\nreduce the number of herbivores and the previous balance in the forest ecosystem \\nwill be restored. And then the number of plants and insects, the amount of rainfall and \\nriver water will increase. We can also plant trees in various places, build shelters for \\nbirds and animals and ensure food for them.’ One of the students said, ‘The villagers \\nshould be warned as well so that they do not kill any animals unnecessarily! But \\nit is quite a complex task. How do we do it?’ So they again met their teacher. The \\nteacher told them not to worry. He said, ‘If you apply to the forest department with \\nyour research report, they can catch wolves from other forests to release them in our \\nforest.’ Everyone became happy. One of them said, we can finish rest of the work \\ntogether. The students did so. As a result, the lost life of the village Shyamoli was \\nrecovered within few years.

Once a terrible battle took place in this locality. \\nDuring that time, some individuals killed a lot of people. This is why the place is \\nknown as badhyabhumi. This monument was built in memory of those massacred \\npeople. Nowadays no one talks much about those people. The place is almost falling \\noff for lack of care. While returning, they all keep quite silent. Questions arise in \\ntheir mind. When and where did the war take place? Against whom did the war take \\nplace? Why did it occur? Why were so many people killed? All these questions start \\noverwhelming them.\\nWe want to know about the liberation war\\nOn the following day, they start asking those questions together when they meet \\nKhushi Apa in History and Social Science class. She pauses for a moment and says, \\n‘Wait a minute! This means you have visited the site of mass killing at the western \\nedge of our village. You have done a great job. Well, you all know that our war of \\nindependence in 1971 was against the Pakistanis.

Although a teen, he was a \\nvery brave member of a guerrilla group called the \\nCrack Platoon. He was never afraid of launching \\nguerrilla attacks on the Pakistani Army. At one \\npoint during the war, Azad was captured by the \\nPakistani forces. After a lot of searching, Azad’s \\nmother found out that he had been detained at \\nRamna Thana (police station). When she finally \\nmet him, she found that Azad had been tortured \\nto such an extent that he could not stand up on \\nhis own. Seeing his mother, Azad told her that \\nthe Pakistanis had proposed that if he provided \\nall information about his co-fighters, they would \\nfree him. Azad’s mother instructed him not to \\nreveal any information about the whereabouts \\nof muktijoddhas (freedom fighters). She asked \\nhim to keep to it even at the cost of his life. Azad \\ncomplied with her advice. Azad had become emaciated because of starvation for a \\nlong time; and he asked his mother to bring rice for him. When his mother came back \\nwith some rice the next day, Azad was nowhere. In her next 14 years as a bereaved \\nsoul, Azad’s mother never touched a single grain of rice.\\n‘This is the story of Azad, just one of the countless martyrs. Stories of thousands of \\nsuch martyrs are lying unknown in each of our localities. Will we ever get to know \\nabout these heroes, the valiant martyrs? Are we going to learn about such heroic \\nmothers?\\n‘We are going to know about them, for sure. However, how are we going to do so? \\nOur local history is not documented down anywhere. Will we keep ourselves only to \\nthe reading of history written by others? Or, are we going to unearth the local history \\nbeing lost in the abyss of oblivion?

That, of course, had the opposite effect.

He \\nunderstood that he would not be able to rule the way Ayub Khan did. So, he promised \\nto offer a new constitution and hold a national election soon. The election was held on \\nDecember 7, 1970. The government assumed that even if Sheikh Mujib’s party Awami \\nLeague would get some seats, the party would not get a majority in two provinces \\ntogether to form a government. However, Awami League had a landslide victory \\n(meaning absolute victory or victory by a huge margin). Out of a total of 300 general \\nconstituencies to the National Assembly of Pakistan, a total of 169 were allocated \\nfor East Pakistan. Out of these 169 seats, excluding two, 167 members were elected \\nfrom the Awami League candidates. As the total number of members of the Pakistan \\nNational Assembly was 300, a party could form a government only if 151 candidates \\nwon. Nevertheless, 167 Awami League candidates won in this election. As a result, \\nthey had a fair claim to form the central government.

In the liberation war, the conventional war \\nbetween the armies of the two sides was fought towards the end of the war. Before \\nthat, mostly guerrilla warfare took place. The guerrillas disguised themselves as \\nordinary people. Then, according to their plans, they suddenly made attacks and \\nquickly mingled with the general public. This tactic is called ‘hit and run’ method, \\nwhich means running away after making an attack. This is why the guerrillas needed \\nsecret shelters inside the country. They needed safe places to store ammunition, and \\noften needed reliable people’s vehicles, boats or even rickshaws to move around. So \\nit must be remembered that many families have contributed to the liberation war by \\nproviding these things. The housewives provided food for the guerrillas, while the \\nyounger children acted as go-betweens. As a result, many have played their roles as \\nfreedom fighters in the liberation war without fighting with arms. You may have known \\nabout martyred composer Altaf Mahmood. Altaf Mahmood is the eminent person who \\ncomposed music for the celebrated song amar bhaier rakte rangano Ekushey February \\n(the 21st February that is stained with my brother’s blood). You can read Ekattorer \\nDinguli (The Days of 1971) written by Shaheed Janani (Martyrs’ Mom) Jahanara \\nImam to learn about the guerrilla attacks made at Hotel Intercontinental. Besides this, \\nit will be much better if you can listen to a guerilla, or someone actively involved in \\nliberation war. You can try to find such a person to listen from them.\\nThe role of nature and climate \\nYou may find it interesting to know about the role of nature and climate during the \\nwar. You know that Bangladesh is a riverine country. There are more than 700 rivers \\nand canals in this country. Besides these, beels, jheels and wetlands are innumerable. \\nIt is as if every village had either a river or a canal. Moreover, there has always \\nbeen the irritating presence of the rainy season. The rainy season lasted for a long \\ntime in 1971. As a result, most of the year, the rivers, canals and beels were full and \\nit was difficult to walk in the mud. Such a landscape and climate are very suitable \\nfor guerrilla warfare. The Pakistanis were not guerrilla fighters; rather, they were \\ntraditional soldiers. Moreover, their country is uneven and dry. They did not have so \\nmany rivers, canals, and beels. They did not know how to swim, and so they were \\nmuch afraid of the water. This natural environment was very advantageous for us in \\nthe war. The Pakistanis could not have survived those nine months if there were no \\ntraitors like the local collaborators such as Al-badar, Razakar and members of the \\nPeace Committee. If these traitors were not there, at least the villages would have \\nalways been free.\\nMuktijuddha in Our Locality', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Through history, we know how people were in the early ages, and how they roamed in the \\nforest and hunted animals. We know how they slowly built clans from small groups to survive against \\nvarious odds.\\nRenu wants to know, ‘What is a gotra, Apa?\\nApa starts speaking. Millions of years ago, people were not in the same situation as today. All the \\nexperiences of present age were unknown to them. They did not know how to build houses like present \\nday people. He did not know how to store food for a long time. They could not even produce food. \\nThey lived by hunting various animals and collecting fruits from the forest. They took shelter in the \\ncave. However, not all the places had caves to offer shelter. Humans used to survive by fighting the \\nferocious forest animals and conquering the adversities of nature. In order to survive, they used to form \\nsmall groups and travel together to collect food. This group is called a ‘gotra’ (tribe). Each tribe had \\nan elderly man as its leader. If there was a conflict in the tribe, he would settle it. He would see that \\neveryone in the party was getting proper food and security. When the adults went hunting, he decided \\nwhere the younger ones would stay and who would guard them. For a long time, people did not know \\nthe techniques of farming. Hunting weapons were also blunt. Humans gradually gained experience \\nabout fire by seeing various forest fires, and lava eruptions from volcanoes. By rubbing stones against \\nstones, they invented the technique of lighting fires. They understood that fire provides warmth in \\nwinter nights and light in the darkness of night. Wild animals run away in fear when they see fire. The \\ntaste of food increases when it is burnt. Seeing all these, humans learned to use fire in their daily life. \\nFor millions of years, fire has been one of man’s main weapons and shelter. Human life in the primitive \\nworld was very slow. Whatever they saw in nature, they gradually used it for their own use through \\nvarious events. They lived this way for thousands of years and gathered various experiences.\\nSo far, you have learned how people came to understand the use of fire. Now let us discuss a new \\ninteresting topic. In the early days, the main struggle of human survival was to gather food. With the \\ndiscovery of agriculture and farming techniques, the struggle for food production began. The human \\nlife changed. Humans had to wait millions of years to bring this change in life. The first revolution \\nin human life (invention of agriculture) happened by women. Men hunted, and women mastered \\nproduction techniques from crops around their settlements. While hunting, many people died from \\nthe bites of poisonous snakes and insects, and attacks from wild animals. Again, it cannot be said that \\nenough food could be collected all the time. Each tribe spent all its talent and energy in collecting \\nfood. However, as they gradually learned to cultivate, the concern about food lessened. Earlier, when \\nhunting was done, when the forest animals and fruits decreased, they had to leave the place and move \\nto a new place in the hope of gathering food. Eventually, instead of a hunter-gatherer and transient \\nlife on the move, people began to settle down more or less in one place. This is how the tribal system \\nproceeded. The lifestyle changed from hunting to animal husbandry. Then the invention of the wheel \\nchanged human life completely. From research, we know that about ten thousand years ago, in several \\nregions of the world, people left the hunting life and began to settle and cultivate.

This period is therefore called the period \\nof ‘Agricultural Revolution’ in the discussion of history.\\nTo this point, you have understood about human food collection and production systems. Along with \\nproduction, people also learned to store food. When people started stockpiling food, inequalities in \\ndistribution of food within tribes and societies began to emerge. This inequality added a new dimension \\nto the history of human survival. The more food/resources a tribe stored, the more power, prestige and \\ndominance they tended to exert over people. By stockpiling food, one class of people became the \\naristocracy and began to dominate the common people.\\nThe urban revolution came after the agricultural revolution. From this time, humans started to discover \\nand use letters of alphabet. Written records of human activities emerged. Historians say that urban \\ncivilization began in history from this time. The cities gave birth to kings, royal families, and the so-\\ncalled aristocracy who were a privileged select group of the time. You must have understood that they \\nhave been placed in this select section because of their wealth, power and authority. There was no place \\nfor the common people.\\nLet us now know how civilization started in our Bengal region in the early days, the way urban \\ncivilizations developed in different parts of the world like Egyptian civilization, Sumerian civilization, \\nMaya civilization, Chinese civilization and Harappan civilization of Indian subcontinent. You will know \\nmore about all these civilizations and Bengal as a region in your Inquiry-based Reader. However, it is \\nworth mentioning here that Bengal was a geographical region surrounded by geo-natural boundaries \\nthat include independent Bangladesh, the Indian states of West Bengal and Tripura, and parts of the \\nstates of Bihar-Orissa-Assam-Meghalaya. In this land, cities were built in the course of thousands of \\nyears of history. Here Bengali language, society and culture emerged. Some elite classes occupied the \\nland and the people and they made kings and kingdoms, fought wars repeatedly, and the victory of the \\ncommon people began after defeating the ambitious opportunists. As a continuation of such history, \\nin a political border of the eastern part of the Bengal territory, the state of independent sovereign \\nBangladesh emerged in 1971 under the leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\\nNow we will know about a few cities of this Bengal region and the early civilization centering on those \\ncities. They are important in the history of Bengal. Examples include Pandu Rajar Dhibi (the Mound of \\nKing Pandu) and Pundranagar. The Mound of King Pandu was built in the western part of the Bengal \\nregion, on the bank of the river Ajay in Bardwan district of present-day West Bengal, India. It started \\nwith the original non-Aryan speaking people living in the Bengal region. And Pundranagar was built in \\nMahasthangarh on the banks of Karatowa river in Bogura district of present day Bangladesh.\\nYou may notice one thing – at that time every famous city was established on the bank of any river. \\nRivers were the main means of communication. Rivers were used to transport goods and people from \\ndifferent areas to the city. People used to spread from one place to another by river and sea routes, \\nand trade continued by these routes. You will be surprised to hear that around two and a half thousand \\nyears ago, this type of trade communication started with the cities of Bengal and different countries of \\nthe world including Europe.

In the \\nancient times, people used various tools to hunt animals and protect themselves. Tools were made of \\nstone, wood and fossil wood. Since our country has no hilly land and no stone, humans in this region \\nmade weapons out of fossil wood as it was as hard as stone. And then they used it as a weapon. Tools \\nused by early humans have been found in several places in the Bengal region. Stone tools used by \\nancient people have been found in Medinipur, Bankura and Burdwan districts of West Bengal. Scholars \\nhave investigated these tools. They believe that people using these stone tools settled in Bengal about \\nten thousand years ago. Some fossil wood has been found in Chaklapunji in Habiganj and Lalmai-\\nMainamati in Cumilla. Humans around 1500 BCE used these fossil wood tools.

For the people of the Bengal \\nregion, it was a bare truth. We came to know from the epics written in Sanskrit that in ancient Bengal \\nsome janapadas (realms or settlements) were established even before the establishment of states and \\nkingdoms. We know from different books written in the Sanskrit language that there were many \\njanapadas namely Banga, Pundra, Radha, Gauda, Samatata and Harikela. Each of these janapadas was \\nknown as a historical-geographical unit. A historical-geographical unit means that each janapada was \\nthe settlement of a group. However, each of them was significantly different from the others in terms of \\nexperience and geographical location. These janapadas had no specific border. For example, ‘Pundra’ \\nis one such janapada. You have just heard about Pundranagar. Pudra is the oldest city in Bengal. People \\nwho bore the name Pundra were the inhabitants of Pundra janapada. Their city was called Pundranagar. \\nThis city was established in ancient times and its present-day location is at Bogura in Bangladesh. \\nAgain, ‘Banga’ janapada was established with the people who bore the name Banga. Present-day \\nDhaka, Faridpur, and Barishal together were a part of Banga. In the west, sometimes the borderlines \\nof Banga were spread towards present-day Kolkata. In the eastern part of Banga, another ancient \\njanapada was located named Samatata. This janapada included the present-day Cumilla-Noakhali \\nareas of Bangladesh and the Tripura of India. These small janapadas were the first political unit of \\nBengal. The people who lived in these janapadas mostly belonged to the Austric language family. \\nBesides, people of two or three language families like the Dravidian, Chinese, Tibetan and Burmese \\nwere also present. Over thousands of years, these people established janapadas and lived there with \\ntheir language, religion and culture; and as far as we know most of them were the ancient inhabitants of \\nBengal. You should know that in different parts of the Bengal region many small ancient ethnic groups \\nwere present like the Kol, Vill, Saontal, Shabar, Pulinda and Nishad. Following these ancestors, the \\nancient janapadas of the Bengal region advanced through the path of history. Questions may arise in \\nyour mind like why the total population of indigenous small ethnic communities is significantly fewer \\nthan that of others. Besides these indigenous groups, there are crores of Bengali-speaking people. How \\ndid they come to Bengal? What is their identity? \\nAll the students in the class along with Nilanto are listening to Khushi Apa’s narration of history. Apa \\nsays, ‘More than 30 crores people are living in the Bengal region. Only in our country, we have 17 \\ncrores of people. Most of the people in our country are Bengali-speaking Bangalis. In the course of the \\nhistory of thousands of years, people of different physical sizes and shapes and from different language \\nfamilies together constituted the Bangali community. This Bangali community is thousands of years \\nold. Considering the language structure, Bengali is one thousand and five hundred years old.’\\nFrom the prehistoric age, people came to Bengal in search of fate, food and business; they lived here \\nin harmony though they had different languages, religions, cultures and ancestry. Though the people \\nof different regions were mixed with the passage of time, some indigenous ethnic minorities were able \\nto retain their ancient culture. Likewise, Bangalis were also able to retain their cultural and linguistic \\nheritage for thousands of years.

Did they always grab food and wealth?’\\nKhushi Apa replies with a smile, ‘The story of the prince and the king is still running in your head.’ She \\ncontinues, ‘Kings, princes, princesses and kingdoms can be seen in different ways in the ancient history \\nof different parts of the world.

They were busy promoting their \\nown name, fame, authoruty and glory. Many ambitious elite warriors from different parts of the world \\nentered the Bengal region, occupied the territory and resources and imposed their language, religion \\nand politics on the people here. They paid no attention to the will and reluctance of the common \\npeople.

Many, however, have faced \\nresistance while expanding their occupation and dominance. Despite the many obstacles created by \\nthe elite ambitious people, the common people here have been living together for thousands of years, \\nregardless of their caste and religion. Common people have developed their own language, society, \\nculture and politics after overcoming many obstacles.\\nLooking at Anwesha and Nilanta, Khushi Apa says, ‘You know that the ancient towns of Bengal were \\nbuilt mainly by the Austric, Dravidian, Chinese and Tibeto-Burmese speaking people. The first major \\nshock to these towns came when the Aryan speaking people established a powerful empire called \\nthe Maurya Empire in North India. As many of you may have heard, the Greek warrior Alexander \\ninvaded northwestern India in 327 BCE. His Indian campaign ended with the conquest of parts of \\nthe northwestern part of India. Shortly after Alexander’s departure, an emperor named Chandragupta \\nMaurya rose in northern India. He built a powerful empire called Maurya Empire. The Mauryas were \\nAryan speaking elites. Around 3500 BCE, they settled from Central Asia to the North-West region \\nof India. Gradually they moved eastwards towards the Bengal region by dominating the original \\ninhabitants of India.\\nTo discuss the Mauryas, you need to know about the Aryan language and some books written in \\nthis language. The Sanskrit books Ramayana, Mahabharata, Vedas, Puranas were written by Aryan \\nspeaking people. Aryans were the first to establish an institutionalized religion in India.

They occupied new territories and tried hard \\nto establish their own religion and culture there. The names of two ancient towns of Bengal ‘Banga’ \\nand ‘Pundra’ are found in the Mahabharata written by Aryan speaking people. A few other texts written \\nby Aryan speakers refer to the people of Banga and Pundra as ‘bandits’, ‘barbarians’, ‘low class’. \\nCan the inhabitants of any region be degraded in this way? We all are humans. Human identity comes \\nfirst. It is quite inappropriate to humiliate or disrespect someone by boasting about nobility, power, \\nlanguage, religion and culture. Texts written in Aryan languages have always viewed their language, \\nreligion and culture as ‘superior’ and non-Aryan language, religion amd culture as inferior’. On the \\ncontrary, it was these non-Aryan language communities who created the well-organised society and \\ncivilization in the Bengal region. The proof of which is the Mound of King Pandu, which you have \\nalready known. But you will see that whenever a new language, kingly power and religion entered the \\neastern part of India i.e. the Bengal region from the distant lands, they belittled the people there as non-\\nAryans and mentioned them in their books with disrespect. This arrogance of some Aryan speaking \\nelite people is not acceptable in history.\\nHowever, let us go back to the discussion of the mighty Mauryan Empire. Chandragupta Maurya, \\nBindusara, Ashoka were the most powerful emperors of this dynasty. The Mauryan emperors occupied \\nthe northern part of Bengal and annexed it to their rule. We know this from an inscription found \\nat Mahasthangarh. In ancient times, kings used to engrave their edicts on stones and send them to \\ndifferent provinces. One such edict has been found at the Mahasthangarh archaeological site. We \\ncall these inscriptions because scripts were written on rocks or stones. After the Mauryas, the Gupta \\ndynasty established powerful empires in northern India. Among the emperors of this dynasty were \\nChandragupta I, Samudragupta, Chandragupta II etc. In the middle of the 4th century, Samudragupta \\ninvaded the Bengal region and captured the towns like Banga, Pundra etc. During the reign of \\nChandragupta II, the son of Samudragupta, the Gupta territory extended to the eastern bank of the \\nMeghna River up to Samatat. At this time, the Aryan speaking people were actively involved in the \\nBrahminical religion in Bengal. The gods and goddesses of Brahmanical religion tried to dominate \\nthe folk religious practices of the common people of the Bengal region. The religious practices of this \\nregion were also influenced by folk elements. They worshiped the Nature including trees, stones, fire \\nand snakes. People following Brahmanism took the ultimate initiative to establish their own religion \\nand gods by discarding these elements of nature. Many of the original settlers in the Bengal region \\naccepted it. Again, the folk practice of worshiping the natural forces from ancient times has survived \\na lot. In this way, the old religion and culture of the original inhabitants continued to mix with the \\nBrahminical religion and culture.\\nAs you must have understood by now, the settlements lost their name and existence due to the Mauryan \\nand Gupta invasions and came under the powerful empires of North India. The Gupta emperors became \\nweak for a time. Their empire collapsed. Two kingdoms named ‘Banga’ and ‘Gouda’ were formed in \\nthe Bengal region. The center of the kingdom of Banga was Kotalipara of present-day Gopalganj \\ndistrict of Bangladesh. Gopachandra, Dharmaditya, Dwadasaditya and Samacharadeva ruled here \\nfrom the 6th century.

At that time, there were administrative \\nunits called Bhuktis, Bishoy, Mandals, Bithis and Grams. These are similar to what you see today as \\ndivisions, districts, unions etc. Also, the emperor used to send great warriors and commanders from \\nthe center of the empire to manage the affairs. These rulers settled permanently in the Bengal region. \\nAlong with them, new religions and cultures, many scholars, priests and business people came. Along \\nwith the expansion of the territory, they also worked to spread the new religion and culture. This \\nwent on for a long time. Whenever there was a disturbance in the central empire or when the emperor \\nbecame weak, many of the high-ranking military officials of the Bengal region declared themselves \\nindependent. Then they cut ties with the center. You will see that most of the kings whose names you \\nwill find in the Bengal region entered the region from far beyond the borders of the Bengal territory. Do \\nyou know what that means? It means that the original inhabitants of Bengal did not have royal power \\nin their hands. They were ordinary commoners. The biggest challenge for them was to save themselves \\nfrom the hostile nature and ferocious animals. So, whenever a state was established in the Bengal \\nregion, it was led by an elite administrator or an ambitious warrior coming from a faraway region. \\nDuring the entire period of Bengal’s history from ancient times to 1971, some ambitious aristocracy \\nhave repeatedly dominated Bengal. They came from the regions of North and North-West India, \\nTurkey, Persia (Iran), Uzbekistan and later from Europe and Pakistan. Following the accounts written \\nby the court poets or historians employed by the occupiers, even today a class of historians are writing \\nthe history of superiority and glory of those occupiers. In those histories, almost the entire experience \\nof common people in the land of Bengal is missing. You will know these things when you grow up \\nand read more history. You will understand how few people of the elite class, regardless of caste and \\nreligion, repeatedly played the game of determining the fate of the common people at their will. The \\npolitical history of Bengal is a history of reappearance of such incidents.\\nStanding up, Anwesha asks Khushi Apa, ‘In ancient times, what other religions were there in the \\nterritory of Bengal apart from Brahminical religion and culture?’ In reply, Khushi Apa says, ‘I told \\nyou about institutional religions. You have also known that the common people of our land used to \\npractice folk religion. This time, let us briefly learn about another popular religion and culture. This \\nis Buddhism. It is also an institutional religion and has a strong cultural aspect. Buddhism originated \\nin 600 BCE through Siddhartha Gautama Buddha. During the reign of the Deva, Pala and Chandra \\nkings, Buddhism gained great popularity in the Bengal region. The Pala dynasty ruled the northern and \\nnorthwestern parts of Bengal for about 400 years. During this time, many educational centers were \\nestablished in the Bengal region.

The people living in the cities of the Bengal region gradually started \\naccepting the Buddhist religion and culture. It quickly spread among the common people. In view of \\nthis, various aspects of the original folk religion of Bengal entered Buddhism. Thus, many branches of \\nBuddhism were introduced in Bengal that were different from Buddhism in other regions. The original \\ninhabitants of the Bengal region worshiped various gods and goddesses and natural forces. Buddhism \\ndid not have the rule of worshiping gods and idols. However, the people of Bengal region accepted \\nBuddhism and established various idols of Gautama Buddha himself. Therefore, it can be seen that \\nwhenever a new religion and culture came to Bengal, the people of the Bengal region adopted it as \\ntheir own. Besides, the new religion and culture retained the thousand-year old culture as well. As a \\nresult, whenever the institutionalized religions entered Bengal, people ignored the strict restrictions of \\nreligion and adopted folk customs to make it a folk religion.\\nAfter the Palas, in the middle of the 11th century, the Sena kings from Deccan (dakkhinatto), India \\noccupied the Bengal region. It is known in history that Vijayasena was the first king who was able \\nto unite and rule the entire region of Bengal in ancient times. The Brahmanical Sena kings imposed \\nreligious strictness on the one hand, and on the other hand created the golden age of Sanskrit literature. \\nDuring the Sena period, the influence of Buddhism in the urban life of Bengal decreased and the \\ndominance of Brahmanism increased. On the other hand, the imposition of orthodoxy and strictness \\nof Brahmanism led to a social revolution among the common people of rural Bengal. Scholars believe \\nthat a section of lower caste Hindus and Buddhists converted to Islam as a result of this revolution.\\nIn 1204 CE, a new kingdom emerged again in the western part of Bengal. An ambitious warrior from \\ndistant Turkey took possession of a large part of our Bengal territory. He is Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad \\nBakhtiyar Khalji. The Khalji dynasty established the Bakhtiyars who conquered Nadiya and Gouda \\nafter destroying several Bihars and educational institutions and defeating King Lakshman Sen. Their \\ncapital was established at Lakhnauti. The language, religion and culture of the Khalji kings were very \\ndifferent from the language, religion and culture of the common people of the Bengal region. The \\nKhalji warriors and kings were followers of Islam, but the people of the Bengal region were followers \\nof Brahmanism, Shaivism, Vaishnavism and popular folk religions. Through the gradual campaigns of \\npirs, sufis, dervishes and sultans, Islam quickly became familiar to the common people of Bengal. The \\nSultans of Delhi and the Mughal rulers deliberately made regular grants of tax-free land in the waters \\nand forests of Bengal. Thus, their policy of land expansion helped increase the number of Muslims in \\nthe Bengal region. Later, various other political and social events played an effective role in promoting \\nand developing Islam and its culture. The customs and cultural practices that began thousands of years \\nago when people first settled in this land have never been completely abandoned by the common \\npeople. This is why it can be seen that despite the presence of different religions, castes, languages \\nand cultures in Bengal, all the people here are bound by a wonderful bond of harmony and fellowship. \\nIdentity as humans has always been more important here than any religion. From Chandidas to Lalon, \\nRabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam, everyone sang the praises of humanity. Chandidas, the \\nfamous poet of the Middle Ages, wrote, ‘Man is the truth, and there none is above him.’\\nAs you grow older, you will have the opportunity to read the political history of the Bengal region in a \\nFrom Tribal Societies to Independent States', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

However, one thing must be remembered that you cannot know and understand the people \\nof this land just by reading the history of kings and emperors. If you want to know people, you have \\nto know people’s culture, customs and traditions. You will see that different dynasties have arisen in \\ndifferent centuries. Bengal was fighting for supremacy with North India. Different dynasties ruled each \\npart of Bengal. The territory of Bengal was being occupied from the outsiders. This is how the social \\nand cultural history of the Bengal region has changed over time.\\nYou must have heard about the Battle of Plassey in 1757. After this war, the English East India \\nCompany took control of Bengal. Company people ruled India including Bengal for 100 years. In \\n1858, by removing the company, the ruling power of Bengal was taken directly under the British Raj. \\nThe British occupied Bengal for almost two hundred years. In the past, fortune-seeking warriors and \\nvarious royal powers came to Bengal from outside; in most cases, they settled here and mingled with \\nthe local people. As a result, people’s protest was less but the everyday life and rituals in life were \\ngreatly influenced by those forces. The British were more focused on extracting the resources of this \\nland rather than settling here. They collected more revenue and forced common people to cultivate \\nindigo in the farmland. As a result, people began to revolt against the British in a great way. Because of \\nthese revolts and resistance movements, the British were eventually forced to leave this subcontinent. \\nWe have to remember that a new religious culture entered the subcontinent with them. The same \\nhappened with the previous elite kingdoms. In Bengal, people’s language, food habits, clothes and so \\nmany other things of European culture are present; these seem familiar to everyone now.\\nYou have seen that the people of Bengal from the beginning were occupied and dominated by the \\nso-called elites of the regions around the Mediterranean Sea, Persia (Iran), and some other regions \\nof the world. The fate of the people of the Bengal region had almost always been determined by \\nthe opportunistic so-called aristocracy coming from distant lands. The people of non-Aryan language \\nand culture of this land were repeatedly exploited. Those who were at the center of power were only \\nconcerned with their own name, fame and benefits. They made religion a political tool to achieve their \\nown benefits. The elites used religion for their own needs since ancient times. Evidence of this can \\nbe found in royal documents of the Pala and Sen periods, land purchase and transaction documents \\nof the Sultans and Mughal rulers, and official documents of the British and Pakistan periods. When \\nthe British partitioned India in 1947 and went back, the elite politicians here took the initiative to \\nbuild a new political identity based only on religion. They abandoned the thousand-year old tradition \\nof Bengal. The eastern part of the Bengal region was named East Pakistan, which was completely \\ninconsistent with history. In the darkness of opportunistic politics of some elite politicians, the original \\nname ‘Banga’ got lost. On the contrary, the name ‘Banga’ was based on many diverse experiences of the \\npeople living in a certain territory over the course of thousands of years. Then, in response to various \\nevents, independent sovereign Bangladesh emerged in 1971 under the leadership of Bangabandhu \\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The king made a plan \\nto buy a fantastic horse as a surprise gift for the princess. The king sent his man to buy \\na horse. When the man returned with a horse, the king asked to keep the horse hidden \\ntill birthday. However, to keep a horse the king needed a stable. So, the king decided \\nto make a stable. The king estimated the space, took help from a carpenter, and started \\nthe task himself so that the matter remained \\na secret.  \\nThe king walked horizontally and vertically \\nand estimated that he required a stable of 20 \\nsteps long and 10 steps wide. Then he asked \\nthe carpenter to make a stable accordingly.\\nOn her birthday the princess became so \\nhappy to get the gift.

The king being annoyed asked the carpenter to \\nexplain why that happened. The carpenter got fully puzzled and he couldn’t explain \\nit. He said to the king, ‘I’ve exactly followed the measurement of 20 steps length and \\n10 steps width.’ The king then looked at the size of the carpenter’s feet and realised \\nthe fact. The carpenter was smaller in size in comparison with the king, and so were \\nhis feet. As a result, the stable built on the measurement of the carpenter’s feet became \\nsmaller than required. \\nSunny says, ‘Now I’ve got it, Apa. If the measurement is not specific, it can’t be exact \\nalso.’ Fatema says, ‘Yes! if Sunny says his home is at a distance of 50 steps from the \\nschool, none of us will understand whether it is to the north or south or any other direction.’ \\nSakib comments, ‘And his feet are smaller than mine.’ All of them laugh at this.\\nKhushi Apa says, ‘You are quite right. That’s why there remain some important features \\nin a map you have already noticed.’ Rimi asks, ‘What is the importance of the scale given \\nunderneath the map?’ Khushi Apa replies, ‘To get the answer to this question, we can \\nmeasure our classroom.’ \\nThen they form two groups. One measures the length and another the width of the class. \\nKhushi Apa: Now we will work in groups to draw the classroom.\\nRobi: But the classroom is too big. How can we draw this on a piece of paper?\\nNazifa: Well, what can we do then?\\nRimi: Can we imagine it as a small one?  \\nShafiq: In that case, everybody might imagine in his/her way like the king’s stable. \\nSakib: Instead of imagining, we can assume one centimetre of our exercise book is equal \\nto a hundred metres of the classroom. How does it sound?\\nKhushi Apa: That’s right. When we are drawing a map we can follow exact measurement \\nand draw it in a smaller layout. The original measurement needs to be recorded as a scale \\non the map. We can now work in groups to draw the classroom on the exercise books. \\nThen they draw a map of the classroom.

Khushi Apa then says, ‘Let’s read the story of \\nDharmagola (ধমদেরোলা) from our textbook. Who is going to start?’\\nMili stands up and starts reading it aloud. \\nThe Story of Dharmagola (ag©‡Mvjv)\\nDemra is a typical village. The means of livelihood of the people of this village is agriculture. \\nMost of the people live together; they abide by the manners and customs of the community \\nand nurture the culture of public welfare. Moreover, they celebrate all kinds of festivals \\ntogether. Once, the village was severely affected by a flood. The whole village was almost \\ndrowned. People took shelter in a school building. Food supply was scarce and inadequate \\nat that point. The village people could overcome the challenge with the help from the \\ngovernment, NGO’s and different voluntary organisation. People had to stay away from \\nhome for several days and at that point, burglary and theft hiked up significantly. To keep the \\nlaw and order situation in check, police force were deployed from the headquarters. At the \\ntime of the flood, the Union Parishod became active in distributing relief materials. With the \\ninitiatives taken by the  Education Board, some of the losses around teaching and learning \\ncould slightly be recovered. However, the real problem started after the flood. Flood water \\nseverely damaged all the crops which were still growing in the field. It also completely \\ndamaged the food grains stocked up in the storage. As a result, there occured a food crisis. \\nHowever, the traditional community which was still active in the village used to believe \\nthat nobody could live well alone. People used to take pride in helping others and that used \\nto be rearded as good deed. Elderly people in the village got together for a meeting. One of \\nthem said, ‘Except for few, all of us dealing with shortage of food. It will be hard to solve \\nthis problem alone. Some of us have rice, some have dal and some have vegetables. None \\nof us have everything needed to prepare food. However, together we can share our rice, \\ndal, vegetables, oil and salt to cook meals for all of us. Then, we can share the cooked meal \\naccording to the need of each family. In such way, we can temporarily solve the problem. \\nEveryone may not be able to contribute the same amount of food ingredients, however, they \\ncan contribute through physical labour, organising fuel or providing assistance in cooking \\nand distribution. Everyone’s participation is most important. While distributing the meals, \\nchildren, pregnant women, sick and old members of a family will get the priorities before \\nany one else.’ The scarcity in food supply could be addressed in suvh way. However, this \\nsituation may arise again in the future. What would happen then? To discuss this, everyone \\nwithin the community sat together. They decided to build a food storage (Gola) to face the \\ncrisis in the future. The storage was named as Dharmagola.

After a flood, they got rid of disastrous situation through mutual \\ncooperation. This way they had human-human interactions.’ Anneshwa adds, ‘Each \\nfamily of the society came forward with whatever food items they had- rice, pulse, \\nvegetables, oil, salt etc. They gathered all these for their society. Those who possessed \\nno food items contributed with physical labour and played their role for the well-\\nbeing of the society. Thus, the people of Demra village had interactions.’ \\nGanesh adds, ‘In the story, besides families, many organisations also worked in \\nparallel with the society. For example, the Government provided relief and the Union \\nCouncil distributed them.’ Mozammel adds, ‘Yes. The school, education department, \\npolice and other institutions also worked for the betterment of others.’ Shihan adds, \\n‘For the management of -dharmagola,a new social institution emerged- Dharmagola \\nAssociation.

With the passage of time, the \\nteam has noticed her as an excellent player. The team has developed her socially \\nas a teammate.

This type of incident usually happens in every \\nsphere of our society. From this, we can understand that social structure plays a strong \\nrole for an individual and for all the people of a society. \\nElements of social structure\\nThe elements of social structure can be divided into two broad parts.\\n1. Social norms: These include conventional norms, values, beliefs etc. These \\nplay a role to determine the thoughts and social behaviours of a person.\\n2.

However, society is an \\nabstract thing. We cannot see him; we can’t say that society is walking or running. But \\nwe can see individuals or families. We can see different groups. Society is made up \\nof individuals and groups. People have different positions or roles. Some are fathers, \\nsome are daughters, some are teachers, some are rich while some are poor, there are \\nmen and women, and children and elders. Their roles or functions are also different. \\nSociety has different cultures, different identities, different values, beliefs, individuals \\nand groups. These groups, institutions, the position and role of individuals, values, \\nbeliefs, etc. – all the elements of the society are arranged in an orderly manner to form \\nthe social structure.\\nSocial status \\nA person’s age, his/her possessions, his/her acquaintances, reputation, position, \\neducation, culture, gender, family tradition etc. form his/her social position. How \\nmuch respect or importance a person will get among certain groups in society is \\ndetermined by his/her social position.\\nSocial roles \\nThe values, responsibilities and behaviors that society expects of a particular person \\nin a particular situation are generally called social roles. Different people perform or \\nbehave differently according to their position in a society. People usually try to fulfill \\nthe behavior that society expects of them while doing these things. When someone’s \\nsocial status changes, social roles also change. For example, what society expects \\nfrom a player is not expected from a cleaner. Society expects different social roles \\nfrom boys and girls. However, they have the ability to play a role beyond society’s \\nexpectations. Note that the social roles of children and adults are different. \\nSocial networks and intercommunication \\nThe interaction between the members of a group and the interaction of a group with \\nanother group is called a social network.

It means, Khushi Apa can communicate \\nwith 42 students’ guardians (84 mothers or fathers) through her students. On a greater \\nscale, Khushi Apa has the opportunity of interacting with 42 families.   \\nFamily as a social structure \\nThe most important primary element of social structure is the family. The first social \\ngroup or organization for a human being is the family. Family plays the biggest role \\nin a person’s development. What s/he eats, how she/he talks, what s/he reads, what s/\\nhe does, etc. is largely determined by the family. A person understands the role he has \\nto play in the larger society through his/her family. What is considered good or bad is \\ndetermined there. For example, if Suman is humble and polite when interacting with \\noutsiders, everyone will like him. If Suman follows this family teaching, he will be \\nknown as a decent boy by others. And if Sanjeeda sees her family members always \\nbehaving rudely, she will get used to such behavior. She will then be known as rude \\nto everyone. People will dislike her. Thus, the family shapes the individual’s position \\nand role in the social structure.\\nElements of social structure\\nSocial structure affects people’s lives in many ways. To understand this effect of social \\nstructure on people, we need to know about its elements. For example, family, culture, \\nlaw, government, state etc. are some elements. These elements are again called social \\ninstitutions. Every social institution has specific purpose and role. These institutions \\nprovide a sense of group solidarity and security as a whole. We can mention the \\nfollowing institutions as important elements of social structure.\\nFamily         Culture          Law          Government           State\\nFamily: It provides the basic security and protection during our childhood and \\nadolescence. \\nGovernment: Government provides uninterrupted safety and security to the citizens \\nthroughout their life. For this, it uses laws and regulations and law enforcement \\nagencies like the police, the Ansar etc.\\nState: The State itself is part of a larger social structure. Besides being a social structure \\nitself, it plays a great role in developing the principles of the State. At the same time, \\nthe State plays a role in changing the social structure through its various institutions. \\nIt makes its existence visible to us by providing various services (such as education, \\nmedical facilities, food, housing, security, communication, entertainment etc.) to the \\ncitizens.\\nNatural and Social Structures', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Various aspects of human life such as quarrels, conflicts, land \\nownership, inheritance, and issues related to various opportunities are governed by \\nthis structure.\\nCulture\\nCulture is the specific pattern or style of behaviours of people as a group in a locality. \\nAlmost all behaviours related to our lives are part of our culture.

Do \\nyou remember the inquiry-based task? If necessary, we can read it again a little). \\nFinally, they make questions about how each structure developed and how it worked \\nat different times in the past. They also created questions regarding similarities and \\ndifferences compared with the present ones. For example:\\n1. How did society develop in ancient times? How did society function? What \\nsimilarities and differences can we find compared with the present societies? \\n2. How were laws in ancient civilisations? What similarities or differences can \\nwe find now? \\n3. How was culture in ancient civilisations? What similar or dissimilar elements \\ndo we find with present-day human culture? \\n4. How was the state system in ancient civilisation?

We can create thousands of similar questions \\nourselves based on our liking.\\nTo investigate each question, they break them down into smaller and more specific \\nquestions.

For example:\\nQuestion: How was culture in ancient civilisations?

Based on the answers to the questions of all the groups and \\nafter discussion, they prepare the following questionnaire. \\nSerial Subject of the observation Data obtained \\n1 Where does the production occur or food/various \\ngoods make?\\n2\\nWhat kind of machines/tools/weapons/things \\nwere used for production or used to produce food/\\nvarious goods?\\n3 How does the production occur? \\n4 Who are the workers?

The advancement of \\ntechnology, in accordance with knowledge and skill, has accelerated the pace of change. There is no \\nalternative to adapting to this fast changing world. The reason is, the development of technology is \\nat its zenith compared to any time in the human history. In the fourth industrial revolution era, the \\nadvancement of artificial intelligence has brought a drastic change in our employment and lifestyles and \\nthis will make the relationship among people more and more intimate. Varied employment opportunities \\nwill be created in near future which we cannot even predict at this moment. We need to take preparation \\nright now so that we can adapt ourselves to that upcoming future.\\nAlthough a huge economic development has taken place throughout the world, the problems of climate \\nchange, air pollution, migrations and ethnic violence have become much more intense than before. The \\nepidemics like COVID 19 has appeared and obstructed the normal lifestyle and economic growth of the \\nworld. Different challenges and opportunities have been added to our daily life.\\nStanding on the verge of these challenges and possibilities, implementation of sustainable and \\neffective solutions is required for the transformation of our large population into a resource. It entails \\nglobal citizens with knowledge, skill, values, vision, positive attitude, sensitivity, capability to adapt, \\nhumanity and patriotism. Amidst all these, Bangladesh has graduated into a developing nation from the \\nunderdeveloped periphery and is continuously trying to achieve the desired goals in order to become \\na developed country by 2041. Education is one of the pivotal instruments to attain the goals and there \\nis no alternative to the modernization of our education system. Developing an effective and updated \\ncurriculum has become crucial for this modernization.\\nDeveloping and revising the curriculum is a regular and vital activity of National Curriculum and \\nTextbook Board. The last revision of the curriculum was done in 2012. Since then, a lot of time has \\npassed. The necessity of curriculum revision and development has emerged. For this purpose, various \\nresearch and technical exercises were conducted under the supervision of NCTB during the year 2017 \\nto 2019 to analyze the prevalent situation of education and assess the learning needs. Based on the \\nresearches and technical exercises, a competency-based incessant curriculum from K-12 has been \\ndeveloped to create a competent generation to survive in the new world situation.\\nIn the light of the competency based curriculum, the textbooks have been prepared for all streams \\n(General, Madrasah and V ocational) of learners for grade VI. The authentic experience driven contents \\nof this textbook were developed in such a way that teaching learning becomes comprehensible and full \\nof merriment. This will connect textbooks with various life related phenomenon and events that are \\nconstantly taking place around us. We hope that learning will be profound and life-long now.\\nIssues like gender, ethnicity, religion, caste, the disadvantaged and students with special needs have been \\ntaken into special consideration while developing the textbook.

Congratulations to you!\\nEnrollment in Class Six means you are entering secondary level after completing the primary education.We are \\nwaiting for you with a new learning approach. In this new approach, you do not have to run after examinations \\nand good marks any longer. You do not have to just know the probable questions for examinations and spend time \\nlooking for the answers. From now on, it is not your principal duty to memorise answers. Your parents also do not \\nhave to worry about effective tutors, coaching centers, guidebooks, your exams and question papers. There will be \\nno need to spend a lot of money for nothing.\\nWe know that every one of you has a fresh mind and a very active brain. You have not only the power of imagination \\nbut also sharp intellect with which you discover different ways of thinking. All of you are born with some other \\nfaculties like the mind and brain. We want to talk about these in particular. We are talking about human senses. You \\nhave already known that we all have five special organs – eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. These organs function \\nas the senses. We see with the eyes and this power is called eyesight while the organ is called visual sensory organ. \\nSimilarly, we hear with the ears and these are auditory organs. We smell with the nose which is the olfactory organ. \\nWe taste with the tongue and it is the gustatory organ. We feel touches with the skin and it is the tactile organ. They \\nhelp us to recognize, understand and know something. This is why these senses are very important.\\nTogether with all these assets each of you have –\\nPerpetual vitality\\nLimitless curiosity\\nImmense ability to enjoy, and\\nA natural tendency to wonder.\\nModern educational specialists believe that the stress of examinations and memorization of answers hinders the \\ndevelopment of these natural abilities. Rather, students need to use these abilities for learning new things, and this \\nonly can give good results.\\nYou are surely getting the notion about your own work after hearing these views. Of course, you are going to enjoy \\na lot of freedom in this system. However, do not forget that you have to take responsibility to enjoy your freedom. \\nAfter all, study is your own job; it is for yourself. You will do your own work;that is a very good thing.\\nThe reality is, when you succeed in something, you can understand how much joy it brings. Therefore, learning in \\nthe new way will be a joyful journey, an expedition. In Rabindranath’s songs, we find a joyous melody of a journey. \\nEducation is the joyous song of an expedition that continues while you walk along humming a melody. You have just \\nenrolled in Class Six. You have gained experience from lessons in Class Five. Many of the lessons in the new class \\nwill be new, with many things unknown. This journey will be like an expedition for the unknown and new things. \\nYou will know, learn and do a lot while overcoming the challenges on the way. You will get endless joy as well.\\nThis does not require any additional cost. It is because you have your own mighty tools in your arsenal to meet \\nchallenges – curiosity, wonder, vitality, and the ability to be joyful. The senses play a supportive role in this process. \\nThe fun is that these are not like money – instead of being spent, these always grow. These are the resources of \\nyour mind and so the more you practice, the more they will shine, the more efficient they will be. Moreover, these \\nwill inspire you to uncover new abilities. Intellect is the first to call. You have to use your own intellect; you have \\nto think. You need logic to think right. This is an area for practice – if you cultivate intellect, it will increase. You \\nmay have seen that if you prune the branches and leaves of some trees, the trees grow better and give more fruits. \\nYou need to sharpen your mind, sharpen your logic. Also, the senses have to be kept alert to increase their abilities.\\nIn this way, you will conquer the unknown. You will keep on spreading light in the darkness, and you will not even \\nnotice when many things have been grasped. Let this journey towards victory begin!\\nIntroduction', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Once Sajib, Ratna, Salma, Shakil, Michael and Monisha were playing \\nfootball in a field. There was a jungle beside the field. the ball was lost in the jungle. Everyone \\nwas looking for the ball; however, they could not find it. After some time, the afternoon came \\nand after that the daylight became dim. At this time, Salma and Manisha noticed an old broken \\nbuilding. They suggested their friends, ‘Let us search for the ball there.’ Then Shakil and Sajib \\nsaid, ‘We don’t know who lives there. What if someone hits us or keeps us captive, or there \\nare ghosts.’ Salma and Manisha were quite brave. With courage and hope, they entered the \\nbuilding and began to explore. In one room, they found a broken chair, a bed and a broken \\ntable. Old newspapers were lying here and there. There was a pitcher full of water. \\nThey got surprised when they entered the next room. Broken pieces of earthenware were \\nhere and there on the floor. On a table, some old notebooks and diaries were kept. Something \\nwas written on some palm leaves. They tried to read it. Although the script looked almost \\nlike Bangla letters, it had significant dissimilarities. It was written with red ink and it looked \\ntwisted. Some black and white photos were kept beside them. In those photos, some people \\ncan be seen standing in front of a worn-out building. Some wall paintings were there. Also, \\nsome carved crafts were there. They entered two other rooms. The roof was so damaged that \\nsome bits of it had fallen down on the floor. It was impossible for anyone to live there. They \\ncontinuously searched for the ball; however, they could not find it. Memories of the damaged \\nbuilding, the furniture, newspapers, diaries, photos, unfamiliar writings on the palm leaves, \\nand broken earthenware were so much fresh in their mind; and they could not forget all these. \\nLeaving the old building in the jungle, they took a stroll and were talking about it. ‘Who stays \\nat this old building in the jungle?’ ‘Why does he live alone there?’ ‘What is written on those \\npalm leaves, the diaries, and the old newspapers?’ ‘Why has he accumulated the broken pieces \\nof earthenware?’ ‘Who were the people in the photos?’ ‘Where was that building located in \\nthe photo?’ ‘How old are the writings on the palm leaves, photos, and the broken pieces of the \\nearthenware?’ ‘Who wrote on the palm leaves?’ ‘Was not paper available then to write on?’ \\n‘How can we read the text?’ ‘From where did the furniture−tables, chairs, and bed− come?’ \\n‘How did the building look when it was new?’ ‘Who lived there?’ ‘Where did they go?’ \\n‘Why did they go?’ ‘Was there a jungle in that place, then?’ In the same way, thousands of \\nquestions burst into their mind. Then, they decided to share everything with Enayet Sir and \\nAnita Madam. Surely, Sir and Madam would share more information with them. They are \\nquite knowledgeable. The next day, they share everything with them during the off period. \\nSir and Madam were amazed at their courage and intellect. They said, ‘You have discovered a \\nbig thing. We don’t even know that we have our history hidden inside the jungle. The person \\nwho lives in that building must be studying either ancient history or archaeology.

We can mention the examples of the \\nEgyptian, Harappa or Mesopotamian civilisations who could write. But their alphabets \\nwere different. The time periods for them too were different.\\nDepending on the ancient samples of man-made things and their usage, prehistoric \\nage can be divided into some parts. For a long period of time, humans used weapons \\nmade of stones, fossils or bones in hunting and catching fishes. Environment, climate, \\nraining, deserts, ice of different place brought changes in these weapons. Humans used \\nwhatever convenient materials they found in their surroundings to make these weapons. \\nVarious types of stones were the main material for the making of tools. That is why the \\nfoundational stage of prehistory is called the Stone Age. After this stage, humans started \\nusing copper and stone. As a result, this latter period is called the Chalcolithic Age (in \\nwhich Greek ‘khalkos’ mean ‘copper’ and ‘lithos’ mean ‘stone’) or Copper-Stone Age \\n(more traditionally termed the Copper Age). After this era, human civilisation emerged \\nin some parts of the world. Humans learned to make things using the metal, bronze. \\nThey started building cities. They also learned how to write, how to plan buildings by \\nmeasuring land, and how to build large structures. By then humans had learned to travel \\nfrom one place to another by sea and make trades. This period is therefore termed as \\nthe age of civilisation in some regions. You might imagine a scenario. Think of past \\ncivilisations evolving at places in present-day Egypt, or present-day Iran-Iraq, or in \\nsome parts of present-day Pakistan, and in parts of western India. When civilisations \\nwere emerging in those places, humans in some other regions of the world were still \\nliving in the Stone Age. Or they might have been living in the Chalcolithic Age. It is \\nbecause people in different parts of the world transformed themselves, their society and \\ntechnology in different ways. That is why the history of all places is not the same. In \\nthe same way, the elements of knowing about history and the periods are not the same \\nfor all places. \\nThe Stone Age is also further divided into three periods (we will refer to them as ‘Age’). \\nThis classification is based on the size, nature and type of stone tools. Moreover, human \\nsurvival, eating habits, lifestyle are also considered. These three eras are: the Upper Old \\nStone Age (or Paleolithic Age), the Middle Stone Age (or Mesolithic or Epipaleolithic \\nAge), and the Lower Stone Age (or Neolithic Age). The part ‘lithic’ comes from original \\nGreek word ‘lithos’ meaning ‘stone’. The Paleolithic Age is followed by the Mesolithic \\nAge.

They are gorillas, chimpanzees, \\norangutans and the ancestors of today’s modern humans (such as various animals \\nunder Australopithecus species).

You will learn more \\nthings about it when you grow up. But the interesting point is that humans have evolved \\nvery slowly from the stages of apes. Many changes took place in their structure during \\nthe development process of becoming modern humans. Major changes occurred in \\nthe ways of walking, clutching, and in the shape of the head and face. The pictures in \\nthis chapter will help you understand these changes. It was required to walk straight \\non two feet to become humans. Primates are used to bending over on two feet while \\nwalking. Sometimes they use four legs. The more they became able to hold things \\nproperly (for example holding a thing for cutting, thrashing, bowling, etc.), the faster \\nthey became like humans. The ability to clutch and use hands in many different ways \\nwere also the signs of changing into humans. Running or walking straight on two feet, \\nrunning for catching something and using intelligence - all these were connected to the \\ntransformation of the shape of head. \\nThe better the use of hands and clutches became, humans adjusted more to the changes \\naround. Collecting fruits from the nearby trees, hunting other animals, using boughs, \\nstones or bones of other animals to make weapons became possible. Another difference \\nbetween the modern human species or Homo sapiens and the previous species is the \\nsize and structure of the skull and size of the brain. By acquiring the ability to use \\nthe hands, the modern human species acquired the ability to use or modify various \\nobjects around them. They gradually learned to collect, modify and use the stones \\nlying around, tree branches and bark, animal bones and skins. Learning to make tools \\nfor various tasks out of stone or wood or bone is a major achievement in the early \\nstages of human development of this species.\\nMany human and hominid species even lived together. You should know one important \\npiece of information. Most of the species prior to modern humans emerged in the \\npresent-day continent of Africa.

Humans continuously struggled to survive against \\nthe adverse forces of nature and ferocious animals. Often, \\nthey migrated from one area to another like the nomads. \\nAt that time, humans spread to the outside of Africa, for \\nexample, to different areas of Europe and Asia. They \\nhunted animals and collected fruits in groups. Stone-\\nmade hand-axe, as the scientists have named it, was the \\nbest invention of that time; they made hand-axe through \\nchipping stones. However, the stone-made hand-axe had \\nnothing in common with the modern-day axe we know \\ntoday. However, these tools enabled man to hunt various \\nkinds of animals, to grind fruits and to cut anything. \\nDuring the Lower Paleolithic or early Middle Paleolithic \\nAges, humans made the second major discovery. The \\ninvention of fire brought drastic change to their lives. \\nThey started to get benefits from using it.

In many cases, these cities were individual states.

Some ancient \\ncivilisations grew in the lands between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates in the Middle East. \\nSumerian, Assyrian, Chaldean civilisations all combined to form a large geographical \\narea to be known as Mesopotamian civilisation. Now-a-days, it is believed that not only \\nthe civilisation was just built in the land between the two rivers, but also many kingdoms \\nand city-states were established within a broader geographical location. Those areas \\nnow belong to countries like Iraq and Kuwait.  These civilisations and city-states had \\nsimilarities in their writing method, religious beliefs, mainly in the common gods and \\ngoddesses. For this, the Mesopotamian civilisation can be considered a combination of \\nseveral civilisations.  \\nIn different ages, many different cities acted as states. The chief or the ruler of the \\ncity was the head of the state too. There was a temple at the centre of the city. These \\ntemples were dedicated to the supreme gods of those cities. These temples were known \\nas Ziggurat. These temples remained in the centres of the plans to establish roads, \\nforts, residence for common people and other structures. Many historical events took \\nplace for the first time in these city-states of Mesopotamian civilisation. For example: \\nfirst written legal codes, first legal assembly, equal rights of women for the first time \\nfor divorce, inheritance of property and business contract, first medical policy, first \\nagriculture report, first literary debate, concept of professional job for the first time etc.\\nMesopotamian civilisations were the oldest in Asia. These civilisations grew with their \\ncities and settlements in Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Turkey and Syria. These civilisations were \\nin ‘the land of fertile half-moon.’ To its north there is the hill tracts of Armenia; the \\nArab Desert is to the south and west and the Zagros Mountains is to its east.       \\nThe writing system that developed here is known as Cuneiform. During excavations of \\ndifferent cities, evidence of this script has been found on stone and terracotta. Poems \\nand epics (such as Gilgamesh) were written in this writing system. The development \\nof agriculture and the production of surplus crops in the fertile basins of the Tigris and \\nthe Euphrates were also the main basis for the development of other contemporary \\ncivilisations. At the same time, various centres of Egyptian civilisation and those of the \\nHarappan civilisation had trade relationships with the centres of these contemporary \\ncivilisations.

During the rule of Senachery, the whole area of the Fertile Crescent \\ncame under his rule. He turned Nineveh the best city of Asia.

In Babylon, 56 miles long roads were constructed with 100 feet height. \\nIn the centre of the city, along with a procession road, the Ishter gate was established as a \\nmemorial for the goddess Ishtar. The Ziggurat temple was dedicated to the god Marduk. For \\nits height, this temple became renowned as the ‘Tower of Babel’. Nebuchadnezzar made the \\nhanging gardens on the city walls to please the queen.

It then flows to the surface in the form of lava. \\nMountains are then formed from lava and volcanic dust. V olcanic mountains are \\nusually steep and cone-shaped.

As a result, Greek civilisation was \\nbacked by the seas and not by the rivers.\\nStarted approximately in the 13th to 12th century BCE and the Greek civilisation had its full \\nflourish in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE.

Generally, the Roman people had successfully \\nestablished a unique and unified social and economic view of life. Therefore, people \\nfrom Britain to Egypt and Spain to Romania accepted the lifestyle of the Romans. \\nFrom the first and the second centuries CE, at the time of the expansion of the Roman \\nempire, much information can be gathered about the then economic and cultural life of \\nthe Romans.

Trade and commerce \\nmainly ran inside the empire; however, it was expanded through Silkroad to India, \\nAfrica and China \\nAgriculture\\nRome was a suitable place for the expansion of the empire. River Tiber contributed to the \\ndevelopment of agriculture in ancient Rome. For this reason, Rome was dependent on \\nagriculture. River Tiber supplied fresh water and fertile soil. Their popular agricultural \\ncrops were grapes, olives and food grains. They produced wine from grapes and edible \\noil from olives. To meet the demand for milk, meat and cheese, they reared cows, goats \\nand sheep. \\nArchitecture \\nRoman civilisation had a bright architectural heritage. The ancient Roman architecture \\nhad distinct features which had not been seen before. The use of arches, vaults, and \\ndomes made their architecture more successful. Roman emperor Hadrian built the \\ntemple ‘Pantheon’ which was considered their largest architectural emblem. Built \\nin Rome, the Colosseum was the largest amphitheater in the world and it could hold \\nan estimated 56,000 spectators. The Roman Forum is a rectangular forum or plaza \\nsurrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the center \\nof the city of Rome. The Forum unified the day-to-day life in Rome. It was the venue \\nfor public speeches, criminal trials and gladiatorial matches. Many shops and open \\nmarket places surrounded it. Roman empire, after transformation, became the centre \\nof religious and secular programs and at that time many temples and monuments were \\nbuilt. Besides, Romans built an artificial watercourse with arches to supply water to the \\ncentre which was known as Aqueduct. In Rome, the length of the aqueduct was 260 \\nmiles. Bath Spa was another architectural emblem of ancient Rome. It was used at the \\nsame time as the bathing and leisure complex. The Appian Way, Roman-built, is still \\nvisible.

What is your religion? What is your home district? What is \\nyour ethnicity? What is your father? What does your mother do? What is your friend’s \\nname? What do you like to eat? What games do you like?’\\nWhen you answer all these questions, all the things you or we say, construct our identity. \\nOur name and address, place of residence, names of parents, occupation, names of \\nrelatives, their addresses and occupations, family status etc. also form our identity. \\nSometimes even the names, occupations and lineages of our neighbours also form our \\nidentity. When we talk about the identity of others, we introduce them to other people. \\nThe people of Bangladesh live in different districts. Sometimes they move from one \\nplace to another. Some live in villages while some others live in small towns in mufassil \\n(suburb) areas. Of course, some live in big cities too. Many of our people live, work or \\nstudy abroad. Many of us travel from one place to another. Everyone’s identity remains \\nthe same while they move from one place to another but sometimes the identity gets \\nchanged as well. Our names remain the same while our addresses change. Our food \\nhabits may change. These happen when we move from one place to another. The same \\nmay happen when we grow up. Others may describe us in many different ways. They \\nmay refer to our appearance, spoken language, dress, gender, age, occupation etc. Just \\nas we feel proud of the identity of our parents, so do the orphans or those whose parents \\nhave both died in the war. Again, an orphan can be adopted by a person according to \\nadoption laws. If any of your parents get transferred to a new place, you may have to \\nmove to the new location. There you may have to be admitted to a new school. You will \\nhave new friends there. Then the identity of your school, friendship and address will \\nchange for you.

As we can have multiple identities at the same time in the present age, in the \\nsame way this present identity could be different from the past ages. Let us explore an example. \\nAt the beginning of the historical age, the people in the Indian Subcontinent were classified \\nas the Aryan and the Non-Aryan. But, actually, that classification resulted in some speakers of \\nthe Indo-European language (those who used to speak Sanskrit). They used to call the people \\nof this region at that time as non-Aryan, robbers or slaves who spoke some savage languages. \\nThey claimed themselves as the most civilised, advanced, and learned. They considered people \\nof different languages, appearances, and cultures from the huge geographical areas of south \\nIndia, present Bangladesh, and north-eastern India as the lower class.\\nDuring that time, there were separate regions known as the Mahajanpads (great realms) with \\nseparate names: Magadha, Gandhar, Mithila, Kuru, etc. People from those realms came to be \\nknown by names of that realm (Janapada), clan, or the city they lived in. They were introduced \\nin different languages also. Today’s Mahasthangar was then known as Pundra. The southern \\npart of Bangladesh was called Gangaridai. The north-eastern region was known as Kirat. \\nSome parts of the middle and southern part of Bangladesh were known as Banga. People were \\nidentified with the name of those regions. Besides, people were also identified with culture, \\nway of talking, or religious beliefs.\\nAt the later stage of history, clear distinctions between the people of present Bangladesh and \\nthe people of the combined regions of West Bengal and Bihar in present India would be traced. \\nHistorians came to know about the separate states (great realms) that existed in the 7th and the \\n8th centuries of the Common Era.       \\nIn 7th-8th century present-day Bangladesh and north and western parts of Bangladesh, \\nmany regions originated based on the differences of languages, customs, and state systems. \\nThe notable regions are: Barendra, Banga, Samatat, Horikel, Raro, Kalingo, Bideho, Anga, \\nKamrup, etc. At that time, the northern part of present-day Bangladesh (it was known as \\nBarendra and Pundrabardhwan) and the northern part of West Bengal, India were known as \\nGaur. People outside call the administrators as ‘the Administrator of Gaur’. People of this \\nprovince were known as Gaurea, Barendrea, Pundradeshea. We have got the trace of identity of \\nthe then people based on their occupation and class.Besides, administrators’ identity was also \\ndifferent. Some people were specially addressed with respect. To demean someone sometimes \\ndifferent identity was shared by high-class people. In some written sources, we have found \\nthat the lower-class people were addressed as Shudro or Osprishoo or Doshyu or Chandal and \\nby calling them the same upper-class people avoided contact with them.

Besides, people of all communities, regions, \\nand people of different opinions were asked to love each other, respect each other’s opinions, \\nand avoid conflicts. From emperor Ashoka to emperor Akber, numerous administrators have \\nurged the people of different identities to live with love and harmony. Sanskrit, Prakrito, Arabic, \\nFarsi (Persian), Tamil, and even the Bangla poems of the Middle Ages or the literature of other \\nlanguages have expressed the stories of friendship, love and sympathy of the people of different \\nregions, identities, and nations. \\nIn the Mughal era, Bangladesh together with some parts of India formed an administrative unit \\nalso known as Suba Bangla. Suba was each of the administrative units. Then Bangladesh was \\nknown as Bangla or Bengala. In the Middle Age many businessmen, travelers, and ambassadors \\ncame from Europe and they have also called Bengala or Banglah. Sometimes people’s identity \\nin different regions was named after the name of the community or region or religion or nation \\nor the language and accent they belong to. Besides, every person had a unique name. Apart \\nfrom their individual names, the name of the region they belong to was also mentioned. \\nEarlier this region was known as Banga. After that, it was known as Bengala or Bangala and \\nfrom that, we have got the name Bangla. Considering the western, northern and eastern parts \\nof Bangla or according to river and landscape types, sometimes people’s identity was defined. \\nSome of them were called Bhatir Desher Manush (people of downstream regions). Again, some \\nof them were called Uzaner Manush (the people of upstream regions). People on one side of \\na river used to know people from the other side differently. From that Banga or Bangala, we \\nhave got the name Bangali. On the contrary, people who speak different languages are named \\ndifferently. \\nIn the past, these types of various identities were there for the people of our country. Till now, \\nwe have various identities. Identities can be based on names, addresses, religion, sex, \\nand customs. In addition, it can be based on nation and citizenship. Including all these \\nidentities we have got our individual and collective identities which have gone through \\ndifferent changes. Every identity bears paramount significance. It is essential for our \\nexistence. Varieties of our identity and its difference were there in the past and are \\npresent now. Only for their identity, we should not demean anyone or hate someone \\nor force someone or oppress someone. Earlier, this attitude was considered a crime. \\nIn the constitution of Bangladesh, this type of discrimination and oppression is also \\nconsidered a crime. With various types of identities, we are human beings. If we all are \\nalike, the beauty of differences and enrichment will disappear. Today’s Bangladesh is \\ncomprised of identity differences and varieties. \\n128', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",
